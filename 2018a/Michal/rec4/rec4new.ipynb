    "  <li>Two solutions that have the same time complexity bound may differ in their running time (one can be more efficient than the other).</li>\n",
    "   <li>To analyze nested loops that are dependent, use a sum ($\\sum$), with the boundaries of the external loop as the limits and the number of iterations for the inner loop in the sum itself.</li>\n",
